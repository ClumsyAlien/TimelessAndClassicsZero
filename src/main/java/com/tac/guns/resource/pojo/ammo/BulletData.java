// The idea is to allow an array of bullet data to be applied, each bullet can have its own resource while connected to the base ammo that a gun can take.
// This allows ammunition types to be implemented, providing multiple projectile options.
//
// To simplify user interface, the game should only display default bullets, either a system allows us to equip a bullet type, as an attachment to a gun, or the player can craft different bullets with these stats.
//      ^ This can be decided after the fact in which path, as it's not immediately required to implement this pattern
